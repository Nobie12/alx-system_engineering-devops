# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

## üìÇ Directory: `0x03-shell_variables_expansions`

This directory is part of the **ALX System Engineering & DevOps** project. It focuses on **Shell variables, initialization files, and expansions**.

---

## ‚úÖ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What happens when you **type `$ ls -l *.txt`**
- What are **expansions** and the different types (brace, parameter, command substitution, arithmetic, etc.)
- What **shell variables** are and the difference between **local and global variables**
- What **special parameters** are and how to use them
- The purpose of **init files** like `.bashrc` and `.profile`
- How to **perform arithmetic operations** in the shell
- How to **create, update, and delete shell variables**
- How to use the `alias` command

---

## üìå Project Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All scripts must be exactly **two lines long** (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All scripts must **end with a new line**
- All files must start with `#!/bin/bash`
- You are not allowed to use `&&`, `||` or `;`
- You are not allowed to use `bc`, `sed` or `awk`
- All your scripts must be **executable**: `chmod u+x filename`
